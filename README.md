## 📄 About

This is the project implementation accompanying our research paper on deterministic ROI extraction for knee X-ray analysis. The system combines a classical image processing pipeline for Region of Interest (ROI) extraction with a deep learning model for osteoarthritis severity classification.

The framework is designed to be:
- **Lightweight** — runs on standard CPU hardware, no GPU required
- **Transparent** — fully deterministic, no black-box preprocessing
- **Risk-aware** — systematic failure detection with safety flags for clinical use

## 🔬 Research Highlights

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) | 0.92 |
| Mean Dice Similarity Coefficient | 0.94 |
| Average ROI Area Reduction | 26.04% |
| Average Processing Time | 4.49 ms/image |

## 🧠 How It Works

### Step 1 — Deterministic ROI Extraction Pipeline
The system extracts the knee joint region using only classical image processing — **no training data required**:

1. **Intensity Normalization** — per-image mean/std normalization
2. **Otsu's Thresholding** — adaptive foreground segmentation
3. **Morphological Closing** — spatial refinement, artifact removal
4. **Connected Component Analysis** — largest component = knee joint
5. **Bounding Box Crop** — tight ROI extraction

### Step 2 — OA Severity Classification
The extracted ROI is passed into an **Xception CNN** fine-tuned on the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system:

| Grade | Severity |
|---|---|
| Grade 0 | Healthy — no signs of OA |
| Grade 1 | Doubtful — possible joint space narrowing |
| Grade 2 | Minimal — small osteophytes present |
| Grade 3 | Moderate — moderate joint space narrowing |
| Grade 4 | Severe — severe joint space loss |

### Step 3 — Grad-CAM Explainability
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping highlights the anatomical regions that most influenced the classification decision.
