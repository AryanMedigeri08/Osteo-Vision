## 📄 About

This is the project implementation accompanying our research paper on deterministic ROI extraction for knee X-ray analysis. The system combines a classical image processing pipeline for Region of Interest (ROI) extraction with a deep learning model for osteoarthritis severity classification.

The application uses a modern **React + Vite** frontend with a **FastAPI** backend, providing a polished dashboard experience for uploading X-rays, viewing analysis results, and downloading reports.

The framework is designed to be:
- **Lightweight** — runs on standard CPU hardware, no GPU required
- **Transparent** — fully deterministic, no black-box preprocessing
- **Risk-aware** — systematic failure detection with safety flags for clinical use

## 🔬 Research Highlights

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) | 0.92 |
| Mean Dice Similarity Coefficient | 0.94 |
| Average ROI Area Reduction | 26.04% |
| Average Processing Time | 4.49 ms/image |

## 🧠 How It Works

### Step 1 — Deterministic ROI Extraction Pipeline
The system extracts the knee joint region using only classical image processing — **no training data required**:

1. **Intensity Normalization** — per-image mean/std normalization
2. **Otsu's Thresholding** — adaptive foreground segmentation
3. **Morphological Closing** — spatial refinement, artifact removal
4. **Connected Component Analysis** — largest component = knee joint
5. **Bounding Box Crop** — tight ROI extraction

### Step 2 — OA Severity Classification
The extracted ROI is passed into an **Xception CNN** fine-tuned on the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system:

| Grade | Severity |
|---|---|
| Grade 0 | Healthy — no signs of OA |
| Grade 1 | Doubtful — possible joint space narrowing |
| Grade 2 | Minimal — small osteophytes present |
| Grade 3 | Moderate — moderate joint space narrowing |
| Grade 4 | Severe — severe joint space loss |

### Step 3 — Grad-CAM Explainability
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping highlights the anatomical regions that most influenced the classification decision.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- pip

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Arnav-Shende007/Knee-Roi.git
cd Knee-Roi
```

#### Backend Setup

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv tfenv
# Windows
tfenv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source tfenv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install tensorflow==2.12.0
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart
pip install opencv-python matplotlib pillow numpy fpdf2
```

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Download the Model

Download the pre-trained Xception model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HnM0EU6zPtJyV8sVtCflVo-qssLPbusm/view?usp=sharing) and place it at:

```
src/models/model_Xception_ft.hdf5
```

### Run the App

You need to start **both** the backend and frontend:

#### 1. Start the Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
# From the project root, with your virtual environment activated
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

#### 2. Start the Frontend (Vite + React)

```bash
# In a separate terminal
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
